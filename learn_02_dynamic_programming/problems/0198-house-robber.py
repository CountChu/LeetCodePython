#
# You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. 
# Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint 
# stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses 
# have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police 
# if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
# 
# Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, 
# return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without 
# alerting the police.
