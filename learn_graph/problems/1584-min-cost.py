# https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/
#
# You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points 
# on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].
#
# The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan 
# distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute 
# value of val.
#
# Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected 
# if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.
#
# Example 1:
#       Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
#       Output: 20
#
# Example 2: 
#       Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
#       Output: 18
