#
# Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) 
# and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
#
# An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands 
# horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all 
# surrounded by water.
#
# Example 1:
#       Input: grid = [
#                  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
#                  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
#                  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#                  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
#              ]
#       Output: 1
#
# Example 2: 
#       Input: grid = [
#                  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#                  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#                  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
#                  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
#              ]
#       Output: 3
