#
# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', 
# determine if the input string is valid.
#
# An input string is valid if:
#
# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
# s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
