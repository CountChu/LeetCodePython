# https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/
#
# An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] 
# represents the pixel value of the image.
#
# You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. 
# You should perform a flood fill on the image starting 
# from the pixel image[sr][sc].
#
# To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels 
# connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color 
# as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally 
# to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color 
# of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.
#
# Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
