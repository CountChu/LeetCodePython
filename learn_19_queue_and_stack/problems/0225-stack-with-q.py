# https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/
#
# Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. 
# The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack 
# (push, top, pop, and empty).
#
# Implement the MyStack class:
#   void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
#   int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
#   int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
#   boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
#
# Notes:
#   You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means 
#   that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations 
#   are valid.
#
#   Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. 
#   You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) 
#   as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.
