# https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/
#
# There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except 
# for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, 
# you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.
#
# When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. 
# Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, 
# and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.
#
# Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain 
# if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, 
# or false otherwise.
