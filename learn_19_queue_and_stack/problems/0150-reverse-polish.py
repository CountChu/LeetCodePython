#
# Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
#
# Valid operators are +, -, *, and /. Each operand may be an integer 
# or another expression.
#
# Note that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
#
# It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. 
# That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, 
# and there will not be any division by zero operation.
