# Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers 
# without using multiplication, division, and mod operator.
# 
# The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its 
# fractional part. For example, 8.345 would be truncated to 8, and -2.7335 
# would be truncated to -2.
#
# Return the quotient after dividing dividend by divisor.
