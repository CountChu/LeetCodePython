# https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/
#
# You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image 
# by 90 degrees (clockwise).
# 
# You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify 
# the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix 
# and do the rotation.
