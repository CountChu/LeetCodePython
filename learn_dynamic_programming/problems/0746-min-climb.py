# https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/
#
# You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step 
# on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.
#
# You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.
#
# Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
#
# Example 1:
#       Input: cost = [10,15,20]
#       Output: 15
#
# Example 2: 
#       Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
#       Output: 6
